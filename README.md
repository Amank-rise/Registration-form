# Registration-form
I have made a proffesional registration form by using HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
This is a simple and user-friendly Registration Form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their personal details such as name, email, password, and more. The form includes essential features like input validation, a terms and conditions checkbox, and reset/submit buttons.
